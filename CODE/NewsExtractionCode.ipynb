      "[['3 Augmented Reality Stocks to Buy in 2019 Chris Neiger, The Motley Fool Reblog Many of the world\\'s largest technology companies have turned some of their attention toward augmented reality (AR) over the past few years. It\\'s been a subtle shift for many of them, but there\\'s a good reason AR is garnering more attention: the market will be worth about $90 billion by 2022. AR devices, apps, games, and services aren\\'t prevalent right now, but recent moves by Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) , Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) could change how quickly this tech becomes ubiquitous. The incremental steps these companies have made over the past couple of years are laying the foundation for an AR future, and investors who want to get a jump on this market should consider buying these companies this coming year. Here\\'s why. Smartphone displaying augmented reality information in a city. More Image source: Getty Images. Apple\\'s big moves What does Apple have to do with AR? Plenty. The company has been busy building tools, through its ARKit 2 , that allow developers to create augmented reality apps for the iPhone and iPad. The apps allow more interactive gaming and have practical uses too, like Apple\\'s measuring app, which uses augmented reality to allow users to measure distances between objects. ARKit may seem like a pet project right now, but Apple CEO Tim Cook is dead serious about his company\\'s focus on this tech. Speaking at an event at the University of Oxford last year, Cook said, \"I\\'m incredibly excited by AR because I can see uses for it everywhere. I can see uses for it in education, in consumers, in entertainment, in sports. I can see it in every business that I know anything about.\" But the company\\'s not likely to stop with just AR apps on its mobile devices. Loup Ventures, which was founded by longtime Apple analyst Gene Munster, believes Apple is working on augmented reality glasses that will debut in 2021. The devices will have an average selling price of $1,300 and could add $13 billion to Apple\\'s top line within its first year. With ARKit, Apple is slowly building out one of the largest augmented reality platforms. Getting more developers to create AR apps now would allow the company to more easily launch its glasses in the next few years by already having software and apps to make buying it worthwhile. Microsoft\\'s latest AR push Just last month Microsoft inked a deal with the U.S. Army to provide 2,500 of its HoloLens AR headsets to the government, with the potential to ultimately deliver 100,000 units. It was a very significant AR deal for Microsoft not only because of the sheer number of devices but also because the deal is worth about $480 million . Up until recently, Microsoft had only sold about 50,000 HoloLens devices. The low number is understandable because the device is primarily used by developers trying their hand at creating new AR games and apps, or companies looking to add advanced technology to manufacturing and industrial training. The deal with the army comes ahead of Microsoft\\'s expected revamped HoloLens in 2019. Rumors have been swirling that the second-generation device will launch later next year, and it could have more of a consumer focus than the current version. With Apple clearly ramping up its AR plans, Microsoft has every reason to make its next device more accessible to the average consumer. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said last year that augmented reality is a \"generational\" opportunity that the company is betting on, meaning that it\\'s a long-term play for Microsoft. That may mean that revenue and earnings from AR might not show up on the company\\'s balance sheet for a while, but Microsoft\\'s current moves in the space mean that the company is gearing up for its AR future. Image of a person driving a car with augmented reality images projected onto the windshield. More Image source: Getty Images. NVIDIA\\'s long-term opportunity And finally, there\\'s a quiet AR opportunity growing for NVIDIA in the automotive sector. About a year ago the company debuted its Drive AR software platform, which allows automakers and developers to use data collected from sensors and cameras on semiautonomous vehicle systems to display warnings, alerts, and other information to drivers. The idea behind Drive AR is that cars are becoming equipped with more sensors than ever before and generating more useful information to drivers and riders, and AR may be the best way to communicate that information to them. Autonomous vehicles are still a very new technology, but with the debut of Waymo\\'s new autonomous ride-hailing service earlier this month and more self-driving tech likely coming in 2019 , augmented reality could soon become more prevalent as these autonomous services grow. NVIDIA is already working with hundreds of automakers to help make autonomous vehicles a reality , and developing AR for those vehicles would be a natural fit. Of course, NVIDIA chips can also be used for plenty of other AR applications outside of the automotive sector, including for gaming and AR headsets. All of which means NVIDIA\\'s graphics processors have plenty of potential to benefit from AR in the coming year and beyond. It starts now, but hold on past 2019 Remember that augmented reality is still in its infancy in a lot of respects, and it\\'s going to take some time for these companies to see significant sales from their AR tech. That means that if you snatch up shares of these companies in the next year based on their AR prospects, you should be sure you\\'re patient enough to hold on to them to see the AR market fully mature.

      " ['By Matt Egan, CNN Business\\nSmall American stocks have tumbled into a big hole, reflecting mounting slowdown fears on Wall Street.\\nThe Russell 2000 index of small-cap stocks plunged into a bear market on Monday, reflecting a 20% decline since hitting a record high in late August.\\nThat marks the first bear market for the index since the downturn that spanned June 2015 to February 2016, according to Bespoke Investment Group.\\nThe Russell 2000\\'s downfall is significant because the index is viewed as a barometer for confidence in American growth . The index contains 2,000 smaller companies that do little business overseas, making them highly exposed to swings in the domestic economy.\\n\"Investors are showing real caution about the pace of economic growth for the US next year,\" said Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research. \"Confidence is falling.\"\\nThe broader markets are also down sharply, but they\\'ve so far avoided bear territory. The Dow declined 508 points on Monday , leaving it down about 12% from the record set in early October.\\n\"People are looking to take any upside move as an excuse to get out,\" said Paul Hickey, co-founder of Bespoke.\\nSmall-cap stocks sometimes lead the broader market, making a Russell 2000 bear market a potentially ominous event. However, Hickey noted that this would be the Russell 2000\\'s third bear market since US stocks bottomed during the Great Recession in March 2009. The S&P 500 avoided a bear market during those other two downturns for small cap stocks.\\nDebt, trade war worries\\nThe slide reflects concerns about rising borrowing costs during a potential economic slowdown.\\nAbout 40% of the debt held by Russell 2000 companies is floating-rate, according to Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group. The cost to service that debt has climbed in tandem with the Federal Reserve\\'s two-year stretch of raising interest rates.\\n\"That\\'s a potential stress if growth is slowing in the United States, which the markets are betting on,\" said Boockvar.\\nFurther, Boockvar said that about one-third of Russell 2000 companies are unprofitable. That number could rise if the US economy stumbles.\\nPIMCO estimates that the odds of a US recession over the next 12 months have climbed to about 30%, the highest level during the nine-year economic expansion.\\nThe Russell 2000 climbed 13% last year as investors bet that US-focused companies would avoid getting caught in the middle of trade wars. Multinational companies like Nike ( NKE ), Apple ( AAPL ) and Boeing ( BA ) dominate the S&P 500 and Dow.\\n\"This was considered to be a safe haven,\" said Colas. \"But it ended up being a very crowded trade. And we know what happens to a crowded trade when the tide goes out.\"\\nBoockvar said the idea that smaller companies would avoid the fallout of the crackdown on trade was flawed in the first place.\\n\"That was idiotic. Small-cap stocks do business with big-cap stocks,\" said Boockvar.'\n",

      " ['Reblog Amazon AMZN stock has fallen over 16% in the last three months as part of the larger market pullback driven by the likes of Apple AAPL and other giants. The company’s days of 40% top-line growth might also be over. But let’s dive into Amazon’s overall business picture and outlook to see if investors should buy AMZN stock heading into 2019. Business Overview Amazon is coming off a third quarter that saw its revenues jump 29% to $56.6 billion. This topped Wall Street estimates, but marked a slowdown compared to the e-commerce giant’s recent growth, including Q2’s 39% surge and Q1’s 43% climb. Amazon’s slowing Q3 revenue growth was likely one of the largest AMZN-specific contributors to its recent decline. However, slowing revenue growth is something that every company will go through eventually based on the law of large numbers. Instead, investors must decide if there are other things to like about Amazon stock aside from insane top-line expansion. First off, Jeff Bezos’ firm is projected to capture approximately 50% of the total U.S. e-commerce market in 2018, up from 44% last year. Plus, Amazon was far ahead of most of its competitors to enter the cloud computing business. This helped it grab the largest portion of the cloud infrastructure services market last quarter at roughly 35%, which blew away second-place Microsoft’s roughly 15%, along with IBM IBM, Google GOOGL, and Alibaba BABA. In fact, Amazon Web Services revenues surged 46% last quarter and 49% in Q2. On top of all of that, Amazon’s subscription business soared over 50% in each of the past four quarters. Amazon’s subscription unit features monthly fees associated with Amazon Prime membership, along with its audiobook, e-book, digital music, and other non-AWS services. Growth Outlook Clearly, Amazon’s core e-commerce business looks strong at the moment as it continues to shine even as Target TGT, Walmart WMT, Costco COST, Macy’s M, and countless others try to adapt to the modern retail age it helped build. Still, Amazon and Bezos have always looked to expand into new growth areas. Amazon is expected to become the third-largest digital advertiser behind only Facebook FB and Google this year, with its market share projected to grow for years to come as more consumers start their product searches on Amazon.com and its app. Furthermore, Amazon has expanded deeper into the pharmaceutical industry with its PillPack purchase to challenge CVS CVS and Walgreens Boots WBA. The firm has also actively extended its brick-and-mortar footprint through bookstores and its newer cashier-less Amazon Go stores, not to mention Whole Foods. The tech giant is also poised to expand its live sports offerings through Prime Video, which should help it stand out against Netflix NFLX and soon enough Disney DIS, Apple, and AT&T T in an entertainment world that is headed toward what could be a completely streaming future. Let’s also not forget that Amazon has become a much more profitable company in recent years, with this trend set to continue (also read: Why Amazon is Ready to Spend Billions on Live Sports in the Streaming Age). Q4 & Fiscal 2019 Looking ahead, Amazon’s fourth-quarter revenues are projected to jump 18.5% to reach $71.61 billion, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimate. Meanwhile, the firm’s fiscal 2018 revenues are expected to surge 30.8% to reach $232.69 billion. Peeking ahead to fiscal 2019, Amazon’s top line is projected to reach $280.4 billion, which would mark a 20.5% jump above our 2018 estimate. At the bottom end of the income statement, Amazon’s adjusted fourth quarter revenues are projected to skyrocket 153.7% to reach $5.48 per share. AMZN’s full-year earnings are also expected to soar 328.6%, with fiscal 2019’s EPS figure projected to come in 37% higher. Bottom Line Amazon’s price movement chart does show us something many investors already know: AMZN stock has been a monster. Instead, investors should note Amazon’s early 2015 drop off that now looks like nothing more than a blip on the radar. Therefore, with Amazon currently trading at roughly 19% below its 52-week high, now might not be a bad time to think about buying AMZN stock as we head into the new year. The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of All Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it\\'s predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce \"the world\\'s first trillionaires,\" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.

The firm has also actively extended its brick-and-mortar footprint through bookstores and its newer cashier-less Amazon Go stores, not to mention Whole Foods.\\nThe tech giant is also poised to expand its live sports offerings through Prime Video, which should help it stand out against Netflix ( NFLX - Free Report ) and soon enough Disney ( DIS - Free Report ) , Apple, and AT&T ( T - Free Report ) in an entertainment world that is headed toward what could be a completely streaming future. Let’s also not forget that Amazon has become a much more profitable company in recent years, with this trend set to continue (also read: Why Amazon is Ready to Spend Billions on Live Sports in the Streaming Age ).\\nQ4 & Fiscal 2019\\nLooking ahead, Amazon’s fourth-quarter revenues are projected to jump 18.5% to reach $71.61 billion, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimate. Meanwhile, the firm’s fiscal 2018 revenues are expected to surge 30.8% to reach $232.69 billion. Peeking ahead to fiscal 2019, Amazon’s top line is projected to reach $280.4 billion, which would mark a 20.5% jump above our 2018 estimate.\\nAt the bottom end of the income statement, Amazon’s adjusted fourth quarter revenues are projected to skyrocket 153.7% to reach $5.48 per share. AMZN’s full-year earnings are also expected to soar 328.6%, with fiscal 2019’s EPS figure projected to come in 37% higher.\\nBottom Line\\nAmazon’s price movement chart does show us something many investors already know: AMZN stock has been a monster. Instead, investors should note Amazon’s early 2015 drop off that now looks like nothing more than a blip on the radar.\\nTherefore, with Amazon currently trading at roughly 19% below its 52-week high, now might not be a bad time to think about buying AMZN stock as we head into the new year.\\nThe Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of All\\nLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it\\'s predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce \"the world\\'s first trillionaires,\" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.\\nSee Zacks\\' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>\\n'\n",
